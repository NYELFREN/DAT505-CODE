# DAT505-CODE
# In this topic, we mainly talked about a way of arranging objects. Compared with previous CUBEs, we can now control the number of small squares by calculating the X Y Z coordinates through a sort similar to the sequence of numbers. In addition, I gave different colors and lights of small squares in different positions to practice.
