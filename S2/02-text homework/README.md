# DAT505-CODE
# In this assignment, I want to use the knowledge I learned to simulate the operation of the solar system. I define seven spheres and give them different materials. I surround one of them with a ring to simulate the asteroid belt. I also use the GUI controller I learned to change the size of each planet to try to simulate more realistic.
